# Elementary Scissiparity

## Prerequisites

Before installing and running the project, please ensure the following prerequisites are met:

-RStudio 2023.12.1
-R for Windows 4.3.3 

## Usage

To use the Elementary Scissiparity script, simply run it in your R environment. Adjust the parameters n_laps (number of iterations) and n_minGroups (minimum number of groups) according to your simulation needs. The script will simulate the process of elementary scissiparity, printing the results in the console. Analyze the output to understand how elementary elements split into separate groups over multiple iterations.
